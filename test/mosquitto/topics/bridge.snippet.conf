# If you are using bridges with cleansession set to false (the default), then
# you may get unexpected behaviour from incoming topics if you change what
# topics you are subscribing to. This is because the remote broker keeps the
# subscription for the old topic. If you have this problem, connect your bridge
# with cleansession set to true, then reconnect with cleansession set to false
# as normal.
